# Steps to Engineer Software Regardless of Use Case

## Product Level Code Attributes

### Error Handling

**Description:** Error handling refers to the strategies implemented within code to gracefully manage unexpected situations that may arise during program execution. This includes identifying errors, logging details about the error, and taking appropriate actions such as displaying informative error messages to users, notifying administrators, or attempting to recover from the error.

**Best Practices:**

1. Implement a robust error handling mechanism that catches different types of errors (e.g., syntax errors, runtime errors, logic errors).
2. Use descriptive error messages that provide clear information about the nature of the error and potential solutions.
3. Consider different error handling strategies based on the severity of the error. For critical errors, the program may need to terminate gracefully, while less critical errors may allow the program to continue execution.
4. Log error details for toubleshooting and debugging purposes.

**Shortcomings:**

- Poorly implemented error handling can lead to cryptic error messages that are unhelpful in debugging.
- Overly aggressive error handling may prevent the program from functioning even in the presence of non-critical errors.

**Do's and Don'ts:**

- Do: Use try-catch blocks to handle potential exceptions.
- Do: Provide informative error messages with context about the error.
- Don't: Ignore errors or rely on users to identify and troubleshoot them.
- Don't: Use generic error messages that don't provide specific information.

---

### Edge Case Condition Handling

**Description:** Edge cases refer to scenarios that fall outside the expected range of typical program inputs or behaviors. Effective edge case handling ensures that the program behaves predictably and avoids unexpected results when encountering these less common situations.

**Best Practices:**

1. Identify potential edge cases during the design phase by considering extreme values, invalid inputs, and unexpected interactions with external systems.
2. Implement logic to handle edge cases gracefully. This may involve validating user input, setting default values, or throwing specific exceptions.
3. Thoroughly test the code with edge cases in mind to ensure proper behavior.

**Shortcomings:**

- Failing to consider edge cases can lead to program crashes, security vulnerabilities, or incorrect results.
- Overly complex handling of edge cases can make the code difficult to maintain and understand.

**Do's and Don'ts:**

- Do: Systematically identify and document potential edge cases.
- Do: Implement robust testing strategies that include edge case scenarios.
- Don't: Assume that users will always provide valid inputs or operate within expected conditions.
- Don't: Neglect testing code with edge cases.

**Best Practices:**

1. Adopt a standard naming convention for your project (e.g., CamelCase, snake_case) and ensure consistency throughout the codebase.
2. Use descriptive names that clearly reflect the purpose of a variable, function, class, or parameter. Avoid overly generic or cryptic names.
3. Maintain consistency in naming conventions across different parts of the code.

---

### Testability

**Description:** Testable code is designed to be easily verified for correctness and functionality. This is achieved by writing modular code with well-defined interfaces and by following established testing practices.

**Best Practices:**

1. Write unit tests that isolate and test individual functions or modules.
2. Structure code into well-defined functions with clear inputs and outputs.
3. Favor dependency injection to facilitate unit testing by allowing mock objects to be used in place of external dependencies.
4. Consider integration and system-level testing to ensure that different parts of the code work together as expected.

**Shortcomings:**
