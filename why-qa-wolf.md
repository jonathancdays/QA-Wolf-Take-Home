# Why I Want To Work At QA Wolf.

### Overview

What caught my attention about QA Wolf is the colorful and impactful branding. The logo and strong contrasting colors stood out to me.

Because I found it interesting I dove into the social media accounts and saw a wonderfully consistent series of posts.

Seeing the written content of the articles on the web about culture, processes, and customer success made me excited to reply!

### About Me

<p>
		Thank you for taking the time to look at my application! It's incredbily
		appreciated! I’m a Engineer with a real passion for creating robust web
		applications. For me, software development, at its core, is about understand
		problems and solving them programmatically. It's almost like solving a
		puzzle in a way ...sometimes it can be a messy, convoluted puzzle. But that
		makes things more fun in my opinion!

  <p>
    	When I’m not coding, I like to get outside and touch grass. I love rock
    	climbing and mountain biking—they keep me active and always pushing my
    	limits. I also enjoy ballroom dancing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
  </p>

  <p>
    	Back in my school days, I was pretty involved in various clubs. I was the
    	Vice President of both the Aerial Swing Dance Club and the Rock Climbing
    	Club at Southeast. Plus, I was a founding member of the Camera Arts
    	Association. I'm sure that you have guessed by now I absolutely love
    	collaborating with others in both a professional and personal setting that
    	leads to tons of fun!
  </p>

  <p>
    	Overall, I’d say I’m someone who thrives on balance, whether it's in my
    	professional work or personal life. I love taking on new challenges,
    	learning continuously, and bringing a positive, energetic perspective to any
    	team I’m part of.
