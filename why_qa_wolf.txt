Why I Want To Work At QA Wolf.

What caught my attention about QA Wolf is the colorful and impactful branding. The logo and strong contrasting colors stood out to me.

Because I found it interesting I dove into the social media accounts and saw a wonderfully consistent series of posts.

Seeing the written content of the articles on the web about culture, processes, and customer success made me excited to reply!


In the YouTube video, I speak about what first caught my eye about QA Wolf such as its branding, leadership, and community-facing endeavors.
